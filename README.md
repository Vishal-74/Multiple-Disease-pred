## Overview:

The project aims to develop a multi-disease prediction system capable of forecasting various health conditions including diabetes, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and cancer.

## Projects:

### 1. Multiple Disease Prediction Interface

- **Description:** Streamlit-based web interface for deploying machine learning models to predict diabetes and heart disease.
- **Files:** 
  - `multiple_disease.py`: Streamlit app file for Model Deployment using Streamlit.

### 2. Disease Prediction Notebooks

- **Description:** Jupyter Notebooks containing analysis, data preprocessing, and model development for diabetes and heart disease prediction.
- **Files:** 
  - `diabetes.ipynb`: Notebook for diabetes prediction.
  - `Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb`: Notebook for heart disease prediction.

### 3. Future Enhancements

- [ ] Expand disease prediction to include chronic kidney disease and cancer.
- [ ] Implement additional classification algorithms for improved accuracy.

## Methodology:

The project utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression models to predict heart disease and diabetes. Data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation are conducted adhering to standard machine learning practices.

Stay tuned for updates and enhancements to the multiple disease prediction system!
